                   <p>Recently, the US Federal government banned online casinos from operating in America by
                      making
                      it illegal to
                      transfer money to them through any US bank or payment system. As a result of this law,
                      most
                      of the popular
                      online casino networks such as Party Gaming and PlayTech left the United States.

                      online casino
                      players found themselves being chased by the Federal government. But, after a fortnight,

                      online casino
                      industry came up with a solution and new online casinos started taking root. These began

                      operate under a
                      different business umbrella, and by doing that, rendered the transfer of money to and from
                      them legal. A major
                      part of this was enlisting electronic banking systems that would accept this new
                      clarification and start doing
